### CPSC 120

* Lab 03

    Lab 03 part 01 was my favorite because it was the first lab where I actually figured out how to code. Before this I was mostly just the navigator and didn't know much about coding but here I learned about the difference of data types as well as the different types of operators. I helped my partner write code on calculating the price of a pizza and I credit this code with teaching me how to really “code”.

* Lab 07 

    I also liked lab 07 part 01 because it was genuinely very easy since we were just improving upon our old code. I also liked how we were “hiding” the secret number in the command-line argument. This lab was very fun to me because it showed me how with any code, you can improve it and there are endless possibilities.

* Lab 09

    The final lab I liked was lab 09 part 01. This lab I liked because of just how lab 07 was the creation of a game. This one was as well albeit more difficult. I learned how to access and open a file from a different part of the lab as well as expand my knowledge on the calling of functions in cpp.
